Quiz App is a lightweight web-based application designed to help users review and reinforce their knowledge through interactive quizzes. It functions as a personal study and review tool, allowing users to actively recall information rather than passively rereading notes.

The application enables users to:

Create and manage custom quiz questions

Organize questions into flashcards for quick review

Use quizzes as a self-reviewer for exams, interviews, or skill practice

Practice active recall to improve long-term memory retention

This project focuses on simplicity and usability, making it suitable for students, self-learners, and professionals who want a straightforward reviewing system without unnecessary complexity.
